**Protein-Protein Interactions**

General structure of protein-protein interfaces:  
There is a core region with tightly packed residues with high hydrophobicity.
There are edge or rim regions.
In lateral region there are more polar residues and a polar behaviour and also water bound residues.
Not easy to identify the exact border.
PPI interfaces have hotspots, i.e. residues or regions with low energy of binding (and, therefore, "responsible" for the binding).
Geometry is quite important because generally PPI interfaces tend to be flat or convex.
The residue composition is quite similar to that of the core of the protein.
Factors regulating PPIs: concentration of the proteins, protein affinity, presence of the interacting proteins in the same cellular compartment. Electric field around proteins. PTM, structural domains involved.
Examples:  

* actine-myosine interactions in muscle contractions
p53  
* cytocrome  
* Antibody/antibody sometimes is PPI or other kind of molecules

What would you do if you had to design an algorithm to predict PPI?
Tips: 

* Find hydrophobic spots on the protein surface
* Looking for residues on the surface. And look for neighbors res. 
* Using HMM we can build a model considering the rims and the core.
* Graphs could help identify clusters.


**Protein small-ligands interations**

* small-deeper pockets
* inhibitors or cofactors 
* can be formed both stable and transient interations
* Ligands can be elements, ions or small molecules in general
* Small means not protein,not DNA/RNA not macromolecules.
Examples: 
cytochrome c stable linked with â€“ heme group in cellular respiration ( same as the one found in hemoglobin with a different function)
penicillin binds irreversibly D-D-transpeptidase and prevents bacterial wall to maintain itself

If you have to design an algorithm to predict Protein small ligand?
Given the structure of protein or ligand we can find the match with the lowest energy so we can assume that can be a docking possibility.

Stable interactions

They are permanent interactions and last longer. 
Usually these proteins are co-expressed and co-localized in high concentration.
Proteins of this j=kind need to be expressed at the same time and in the same place.

Example:
ATPase in which more subunits interact to produce ATP and interact in stable ways.
In general any complex has a stable interaction with sub-units.


transient interactions

investigating transient interactions, first of all as the name sad there are not permanent (exact time unknown)
divide between :
weak (last less time; seconds or less)
smaller interface (about 12 residues from a couple of example)
lower affinity (related to number of bonds)
strong (last longer; seconds or more)
higher affinity

very low kb at level of micro molars for weak interaction and strong interaction are in the range of millimolars.

example of cascade signal (from outside to inside the cell) that must be quick.

Example :
Laccase (fungal) where we have Glycosilation site and short pattern (N X S/T N)
TP53 has got NLS (nuclear localisation signal, 12 res) and NES (17 res, Nuclear export signal)
